B major

(verse 1)

B
There is a day,
        G#m                    B   Bsus  B
we will meet on the streets of Gold
There is a time,
        G#m              B       Bsus   B
we will see one another face to face

        C#m     D#m
On that day, no longer we will cry
C#             E             F
touched by His glory we will fly

B                       F#       F#
We will spend eternity, together together
B                   F#
Never will we part, Forever.. Forever
B
living near the throne of almighty God almighty God
G#m               E        F#
face to face with purified souls

          Bm    Em          Emsus E     Bm
but we're here, living in a hur - ting  world
we need your glory to keep us from a fall
shield us    cover our eyes     from the darkness all around
help us shine while here to rescuse those made in your image.
