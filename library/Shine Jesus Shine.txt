Lord, I come to Your awesome presence
From the shadows into your radiance
By the blood I may enter Your brightness
Search me, try me consume all my darkness
Shine on me
shine on me

As we gaze on your kingly brightness
So our faces display your likeness
Ever changing from glory to glory
Mirrored here may our lives tell your story
Shine on me
shine on me
