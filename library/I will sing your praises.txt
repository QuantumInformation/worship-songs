 Father God I Wonder how I managed
                       C
to exist without the knowledge
                                 D                        B7
of Your parenthood and Your loving care
       Em                     D
But now I am Your son, I am adopted in Your family
       C
and I can ever be alone
           D                            B
'cause Father God You're there beside me

Em     C
I will sing Your praises
|D        G
 I will sing Your praises
Em    Am
I will sing your praises
D          B7
for ever more x3


D           Em
for ever more  (last time)
