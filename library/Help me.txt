     D             D            |A
     Lord, help me walk another mile... just one more mile

     A            A            D
     I'm tired of walking all alone

    |D             D             A            |
     Lord, help me smile another smile... just one more smile

    |A                    A              D
     -I know, I just can't make it, on my own


     CHORUS:
     |G                               D    |
      ~I never thought I needed help before
     A                                     D   |
     I thought that I could do things by myself
     G                                  D
     Now I know I just can't take it anymore
     A [tacet]
     With a humble heart, on bended knee, I'm begging you please
     D
     Help me.

                                          A
     Come down from your golden throne to me, lowly me
     I need to feel the tough of your tender hand
     Remove the chains of darkness and let me see, Lord, let me see

     Just where I fit into your master plan.

     G          G               G       A D
     Help...
