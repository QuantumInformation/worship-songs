  1                    6m7
The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty,
                    42
Let all the earth rejoice, all the earth rejoice.
   1                          |6m7
He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide,
      |              42                      |
And tr-embles at his voice, trembles at his v-oice.


Chorus:
   |1                   5/3
How great is our God, sing with me,
    6m7
How great is our God, all will see,
    4           5            1
How great, how great is our God.

Verse 2:

Age to age He stands, and time is in His hands,
                  C2
Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
     1                     6m7
The Godhead, three in one: Father, Spirit, Son,
                 42
The Lion and the Lamb, the Lion and the Lamb.

How great is our God.
