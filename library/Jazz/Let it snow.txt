        G          D7      G        
Oh, the weather outside is frightful,    
        D       A7   D 
But the fire is so delightful, 
    Am             E7       Am 
And since we've no place to go, 
       D7           Bm           G 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.

 
   G            D7       G         
It doesn't show signs of stopping, 
      D            A7       D 
And I brought some corn for popping. 
    Am                E7       Am 
The lights are turned way down low, 
       D7           Bm           G 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow 


        D 
When we finally kiss good night,    
         Em         A7         D 
How I'll hate going out in the storm. 
       D 
But if you really hold me tight, 
E7          A7           D 
All the way home I'll be warm. 


    G       D7     G    
The fire is slowly dying, 
        D           A7        D 
And, my dear, we're still goodbye-ing, 
       Am          E7      Am 
But as long as you love me so. 
       D7           Am           G 
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
