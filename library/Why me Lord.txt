Intro - A - E - B7 - E - B7

(verse 1)
         E                     A
Why me Lord, what have I ever done
                 E                         B7
To deserve even one Of the pleasures I've known
          E                   A                        E
Tell me Lord, what did I ever do That was worth loving you
         B7              E - E7
Or the kindness you've shown.

 A                         E
Lord help me Jesus, I've wasted it so Help me
 B7                 E - E7
Jesus I know what I am
 A                         E
Now that I know that I've need you so Help me
 B7                        E - B7
Jesus, my soul's in your hand.

(verse 2)
Tell me Lord, if you think there's a way
I can try to repay All I've taken from you
Maybe Lord, I can show someone else
What I've been through myself On my way back to you.
