       D            G          D
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
                         A7
That saved a wretch like me.
     D                G       D
I once was lost, but now im found,
               A7     D
Was blind, but now I see.


[Verse 2]

    D                        G       D
Twas grace that thought my heart to fear,
                      A7            D
and grace my fears released. How precious
      G          D                  A7     D
did that grace appear, the  hour I first believed.


[Verse 3]

 D                           G       D
When we've been there ten thousand years,
 D                     A7
bright shining as the sun,
  D                     G           D
we've no less days to sing god's praise
  D                A7         D
than when did when we first begun.


[Verse 1]

D            G          D
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
                         A7
That saved a wretch like me.
     D                G       D
I once was lost, but now im found,
               A7     D
Was blind, but now I see.
