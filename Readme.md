###Chord notation

In order to be able to transpose songs its useful to be able to know the chord in relation to the key.
So you can learn numbers like 1 or 4  fr chords G and C respectively in the key of G major, see "Above all powers song"

###Symbols

| Symbol       |                                 Purpose                                 |
|--------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <page break> | This specifies a reader to display this in the next column of a viewer. |
| -            |                               1 beat rest                               |
| ~            |                              1/2 beat rest                              |
NOTE: the rest symbols are just to help song learners know when to come in as in most chord sheets 
this is not shown. Eg in this part or Breathe:
```
|1             |4
 --~This is the air I breathe
|1             |4
 --~This is the air I breathe
 ```

 In the above case, the words start on beat 3 + semi quaver rest
